Grocery list outline

Model the page off of amazon

The page needs the list of all of the groceries the user plans to buy.
- a list of pictures displaying what the user plans to buy

The page needs a way for the user to add new groceries to the list.
- buttons that add groceries to list

The page needs a way for the user to organize the list by moving groceries up and down.
- a selection on the pictures, then an up/down button that moves the selected grocery

The page needs a button or icon so that an item can be deleted from the list.
- a button that deletes the last item in the list

The page should be intuitive and attractive.
- modeled after Amazon cart

Backend
- get a list of all pictures(representing the groceries)
- removing a grocery involves these steps
	- selected grocery becomes nulled out in the array( [milk, bread, null, ham, tomato])
	- then display() func is run, moving the nulled element towards the back of the list, and displaying the photos
- adding a grocery involves replacing a null value (which is always at the end) and inserting the picture source
- moving up/down involves selecting the picture (which corresponds to an index in the list), then a movement up or down
  swaps the element before/after the selected element. A variable keeps track of the movement to keep at the selected item's index
  (for example, you click element at index 2, and move it up, making that element be at index 1)
